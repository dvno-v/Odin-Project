    <h1>Different types of images</h1>
    <h2>JPGs</h2>

    <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.jpg' />

    <!-- Jpg images hold large colour pallets so they are good for photos with lots of gradients in them, they do not have transparent pixels-->

    <h2>GIFs</h2>

    <p>Gifs are good for simple animations.</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.gif'/>

    <!-- Gifs are good for simple animations. They also have transparent pixels, but its a binary choise between transparent and colour. They do not allow samiopaque pixels-->


    <h2>PGNs</h2>

    <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.png'/>

    <!-- PGNs are good for anything that is not a photo or an animation. They do not have problems with opague pixes and colour palletes. But generally, if a photo is in the PNG format, it will be bigger than the same photo in the JPG format. This makes them good for icons, logos, diagrams-->

    <h2>SVGs</h2>

    <p>SVGs are really good, use whenever you can</p>

    <img src='images/mochi.svg'/>

    <!-- SVGs are really good in the cases where an PNG would be suitable. They are not like the other images, because they are vector based, meaning that they can be rescaled without the loss of quality.-->
