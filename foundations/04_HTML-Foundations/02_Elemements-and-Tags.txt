What is an HTML Tag?

The HTML tag is a way to tell the browser what content an Element contains.
We can think of Elements as a content that is wrapped in between tags. 
We have two types of tags - an opening and a closing tag that specify where 
the content begins and where it ends. A tag begins with < then a keyword to 
specify what kind of tag that is e.g. p and then a closing >.
The closing tag consists of </ a keyword to specify which tag it is and then
>
There are also a third time of tags that are self closing, that do not hold
content themselves. These are tags like <img> and <br>.

What are the three parts of an HTML Element?

The three parts of an HTML element are the Opening tag, the content of the
element and Closing tag.
