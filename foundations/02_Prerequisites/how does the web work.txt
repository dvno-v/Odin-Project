What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?
The data that is moved around the Web is not sent in one. The data is chopped into multiple smaller pieces. These smaller pieces that are sent from the Server towards the Client are called packets. 
One of the reasons why packets are used, is because they are smaller. If a packet is corrupted, it is easier to replace, also they can be router thought different Internet Routes. 
Also that way, the Cliernt can start putting the information together long before all of the information is present. This allows it to have a faster user experience.

What is a client?

What is a DNS request?

In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.
When we search in google.com, the first thing that is happening is, our browser is sending a request to the Google.com DNS. 
After that the original google.com IP is called. After that the request makes it to the google.com server which takes the request, 
sees what we want to search for and then brings up a collection webpages that are meeting the requerments of our search. 
The web server compiles the result of the search in a way that will be readable for our browser and the user and then sends a response to our web browser. 
After the respose is send, the browser loads up the web page and view it.The page contains all of our pages that meet our search requirement.
