What are the main differences between external, internal, and inline CSS?

External CSS is css that is present in a separate file that is independent of the HTML file which is linking it.
Internal CSS is CSS that is written in the <style> tag that is present in the HTML file.
Inline CSS is CSS that is written in the HTML element.
Besides where the CSS is present, there is also the difference of importance of the CSS that is applied. If there is a conflict between CSS styles, CSS picks the last defined style, so the order goes by External -> Internal -> Inline. 


What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?

The syntax for the class selector is .name-of-class and for the ID selector is #name-of-id

How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?

We put the selectors after each other separated by a comma. E.g. .class1, .class2 {}

Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?

.title#primary {}

What does the descendant combinator do?

Its a combination of selectors that look up first the element with the first selector, then an ancestor with the next selector and so on.
E.g. .class1 .class 2 {} looks up an html element with class class1, then it searches for an ancestor of that element with a class class2

Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?

The class selector will have higher specificity, because the class selector has higher priority and specificity than the type selectors.
